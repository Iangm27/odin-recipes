    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled pizza recipe uses pizza dough made from scratch, topped with mozzarella cheese, sauce, and your choice of savory toppings. Grilled to perfection for a fun outdoor treat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's Pizza Crust Yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cocoa powder1 ⅓ cups warm water (120 to 130 degrees F/50 degrees C)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil, more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well combined, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough flour to form a slightly sticky dough ball. Knead on a floured work surface until dough is smooth, elastic, and not sticky, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 equal portions. Pat or roll dough on a floured work surface to about 8-inch circles (they don't need to be perfect).</li>
        <li>Brush both sides of crusts with additional oil; place on the grill. Cook until bottoms are lightly browned and tops look set, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove crusts from grill with long-handled tongs; place on a baking sheet, grilled-side up.</li>
        <li>Spread a light coating of sauce over each crust. Top with cheese.</li>
        <li>Slide pizzas back on the grill. Cook until bottom crusts are brown and cheese melts, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
